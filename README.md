# Hi, I'm Joshua

Hi, I’m Joshua. I’m a seasoned software engineer with over ten years of experience building robust and scalable solutions. My software journey began at Clemson University, where I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. I’ve lived in the Upstate of South Carolina since my high school days.

Professionally, I’m a full stack engineer developing mostly in C# and Blazor. I also have a solid professional foundation in Java, React, and Python. When time allows I work in DevOps roles and have experience in both AWS and Azure. I also have experience in Kubernetes via my homelab work.

When I’m not in front of a computer I enjoy photography, flying my drone, and spending time with my family.
